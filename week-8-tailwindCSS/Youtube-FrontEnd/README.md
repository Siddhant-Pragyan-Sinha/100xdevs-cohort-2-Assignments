# YouTube Frontend Clone ðŸŽ¥ðŸš€

This repository contains the source code for a modern, responsive YouTube frontend clone, meticulously crafted using Next.js for server-side rendering and dynamic routing, along with Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. The goal of this project is to replicate the core functionalities of YouTube, including video browsing, search, and user interaction features, while emphasizing performance, scalability, and ease of use.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a sleek, mobile-first design that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Utilizes Next.js' powerful routing capabilities to create a seamless navigation experience.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enhances performance and SEO through SSR, ensuring fast load times and better visibility on search engines.
- **Video Playback**: Supports video playback with controls, allowing users to watch videos directly within the app.
- **Search Functionality**: Implements a robust search feature to help users find content quickly and efficiently.
- **User Interaction**: Includes features such as liking, commenting, and sharing videos, mirroring the full functionality of the original YouTube platform.

Feel free to adjust the description based on the specific features and goals of your project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
