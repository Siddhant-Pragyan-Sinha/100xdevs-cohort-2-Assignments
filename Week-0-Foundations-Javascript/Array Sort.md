The explanation of the `sort` method and its comparator function in simpler terms.

### The `sort` Method

In JavaScript, arrays have a method called `sort` that can be used to sort the elements of the array. By default, `sort` converts each element to a string and then sorts them in lexicographic (alphabetical) order. However, this default behavior is not always what you want, especially when dealing with numbers or custom objects.

### The Comparator Function

To customize the sorting behavior, you can pass a comparator function to the `sort` method. This function should return a negative, zero, or positive value, depending on the arguments.

- **Negative**: If the function returns a negative value, the first argument (`a`) is sorted to an index lower than the second argument (`b`).
- **Zero**: If the function returns zero, the order of `a` and `b` is unchanged.
- **Positive**: If the function returns a positive value, the first argument (`a`) is sorted to an index higher than the second argument (`b`).

### Example: `(a, b) => a - b`

In the `sortExample` function, the comparator function is `(a, b) => a - b`. This function takes two elements from the array, `a` and `b`, and subtracts `b` from `a`.

- If `a` is less than `b`, the result is a negative number, which means `a` should come before `b` in the sorted array.
- If `a` is equal to `b`, the result is zero, which means the order of `a` and `b` is unchanged.
- If `a` is greater than `b`, the result is a positive number, which means `a` should come after `b` in the sorted array.

### Sorting in Ascending Order

By using this comparator function, the `sort` method sorts the array in ascending order based on the numerical values of its elements. This is because when `a` is less than `b`, the function returns a negative value, indicating that `a` should come before `b`.

In summary, the comparator function `(a, b) => a - b` is used to tell the `sort` method how to sort the array elements in ascending order based on their numerical values.
